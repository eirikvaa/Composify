# Piece
The idea is that Piece should be a scratchpad for your song projects. You can add projects that correspond to your songs, and then add sections (intro, verse, solo, ...) and recordings. This makes it easy to stay organized when working on a song; you can have different versions of an intro, or even different versions of the same project.

Right now Piece is kind of MVP (minimum viable product); it does what I wanted it to do, but the absence of any real design makes it difficult to release on the App Store. This is my first application, so I'm doing this more for myself than any other; this is a learning process for learning iOS development, Swift, Git and the whole process of releasing an app from idea to finished product.
